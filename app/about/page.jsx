              When they came into the world they were delicately cradled by the hands of the lustrous Doniazate, their good aunt, who engraved their names on gold leaves colored with wet gemstones and cared for them under the velvet of her pupils until their hard adolescence, to scatter them afterwards, voluptuous. and free, on the oriental world, eternalized by his smile.

There is only one honest and logical method of translation: "literality," an impersonal literality, barely tempered by a slight blink and a slight smile from the translator. She creates, suggestively, the greatest literary power. She produces the pleasure of evocation. She is the guarantee of the truth. She is firm and immutable, in her stone nakedness. She captivates the primitive scent and crystallizes it. She separates and unties... She fixes.
